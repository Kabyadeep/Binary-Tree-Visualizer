# 🌳 Binary Search Tree Visualizer

An interactive **Binary Search Tree (BST) Visualizer** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project helps in understanding how BST operations work internally through clear visual representation and animations.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Binary Search Tree Visualizer** demonstrates the working of BSTs by showing:

- how nodes are inserted into the tree  
- how traversals visit nodes  
- how search decisions move left or right  

The project focuses on **learning data structures through visualization** rather than memorization.

## 🚀 Features

- Insert values into a Binary Search Tree  
- Visual tree structure with parent–child connections  
- Animated traversal operations:
  - Inorder
  - Preorder
  - Postorder
- Step-by-step search path visualization  
- Highlighting of active, found, and not-found nodes  

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Tree Traversals
- Search Algorithms
- Recursion
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- DOM Manipulation
- SVG-based drawing

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Page structure  
- **CSS** – Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** – BST logic, traversal, animation, and visualization

## 🎯 Learning Outcome

By building this project, you gain a clear understanding of:

- how BSTs store and organize data  
- how traversals work internally  
- how search decisions reduce complexity  
- how data structures can be visualized using web technologies

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- AVL Tree with rotation visualization  
- Delete operation animation  
- Backend integration using Flask  
- Support for large trees with zoom and pan
